# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates an ArithmeticException in Java, specifically the exception caused by division by zero.  The code includes a simple example and a solution to handle the potential error using exception handling. Understanding exception handling is crucial for robust and error-free Java applications.  This is a common error, however it's importance in understanding the exception and handling it correctly is what makes it uncommon.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler (javac): `javac UncommonBug.java`
3. Run the compiled code: `java UncommonBug` (This will result in an exception)
4. Compile the solution: `javac UncommonBugSolution.java`
5. Run the solution: `java UncommonBugSolution` (This will handle the exception gracefully)
